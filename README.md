# London Surface Area Web App - Sustainable Housing Hackathon with homefolk and UCL SU

This is a web app developed during a one day hackathon organised by UCL SU and the social enterprise homefolk. The app allows users to input a postcode in London, and returns the breakdown of paved, non-paved and building footprint surface area breakdown in the neighbourhood around the postcode. It is currently still at a prototype stage. Ultimately, it aims to support Homefolk's vision in identifying opportunity areas for tiny housing and its 'village' model.
